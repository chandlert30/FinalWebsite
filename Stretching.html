    <h1>Why Stretch?</h1>

    <h2>Why is Stretching Important?</h2>
    <img src="chandler is tired omg.png" id="image12">
    <p>Stretching is vital toward getting a good workout. Being loose will allow your body to push through exercises and
        do more reps. While not stretching can actually hurt and could physically injure you. D3 Conditioning has
        provided you with a list of stretching exercises that will get your body loose for our programs.</p>
