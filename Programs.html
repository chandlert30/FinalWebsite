    <h1>What Programs do we Provide?</h1>

    <h2>Conditioning Programs</h2>
    <p>We specialize in creating Conditioning Programs that allow you to get your body into shape within a month. We
        have split our programs up into two different groups. The first group "The Beginner Program" is designed for
        people who are out of shape right now, and are beginning, as well as, wanting to get into good shape. The second
        group is the "Elite Conditioning Program" this plan is for people who are already in pretty good shape but want
        to get into elite shape to be able to run longer distances for longer amounts of time.</p>

    <h3>The Beginner Program</h3>
    <p>As mentioned before, this program is for people who are just starting out. There is absolutely no shame in
        starting with the beginner plan, I actually reccommend it because it will get you more suited for the Elite
        plan. Plus, everybody has to start somewhere and this plan is perfect for people who are just starting out. I
        believe this program is perfect for newbies because it is not meant to wear you out in the beginning, all it is
        trying to do is get you in a routine of running/walking before we get into the more difficult running that
        really tests you.</p>

    <h3>The Elite Program</h3>
    <p>The elite program is for people who are already in pretty good shape, and who already run regulary. If you are
        signing up for this program, you are really looking for a challenge, I have this plan set up to get you going in
        the beginning. Every workout you encounter in this plan will test you, but if you prevail you will be in elite
        athlete level shape. This program is perfect for athletes and people looking to take their conditioning to the
        next level.</p>
