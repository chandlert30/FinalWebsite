    <h1>What Programs do we Provide?</h1>

    <h2>Conditioning Programs</h2>
    <p>We specialize in creating Conditioning Programs that allow you to get your body into shape within a month. We
        have split our programs up into two different groups. The first group "The Beginner Program" is designed for
        people who are out of shape right now, and are beginning, as well as, wanting to get into good shape. The second
        group is the "Elite Conditioning Program" this plan is for people who are already in pretty good shape but want
        to get into elite shape to be able to run longer distances for longer amounts of time.</p>

    <h3>The Beginner Program</h3>
    <p>As mentioned before, this program is for people who are just starting out. There is absolutely no shame in
        starting with the beginner plan, I actually reccommend it because it will get you more suited for the Elite
        plan. Plus, everybody has to start somewhere and this plan is perfect for people who are just starting out. I
        believe this program is perfect for newbies because it is not meant to wear you out in the beginning, all it is
        trying to do is get you in a routine of running/walking before we get into the more difficult running that
        really tests you.</p>

    <h3>The Elite Program</h3>
    <p>The elite program is for people who are already in pretty good shape, and who already run regulary. If you are
        signing up for this program, you are really looking for a challenge, I have this plan set up to get you going in
        the beginning. Every workout you encounter in this plan will test you, but if you prevail you will be in elite
        athlete level shape. This program is perfect for athletes and people looking to take their conditioning to the
        next level.</p>

    <h2>At Home Strength Programs</h2>
    <p>We also provide our customers with At Home Workout Plans because you do not always need to go to a gym to build
        your muscles. There are plenty of exercises you can do at home that will bring you the same, if not, more
        benefit than going to a gym. Plus, this will save you gas and make you more comfortable working out since you
        will be doing it in the comfort of your own home. We split our programs into two months, the "first month" which
        is more about builidng muscle, and the "second month" which is about building muscle but specializing in getting
        you more explosive.</p>

    <h3>The First Month, Building Muscle</h3>
    <p>This month is all about getting building muslce using no equipment at all. All you need is a space in your house
        and that is IT. There will be many bodyweight exercises that you will be familiar with along with others that
        you may not be so familiar with. However, don't worry, our programs provide you with videos that explain to you
        how to do each exercise. There will also be ab exercises after each workout which will test you mentally, but
        getting through it will get you those 6-pack abs that you have been craving. If you stick with this plan, you
        will not only get stronger, but you may even be stronger than your friends who go to a actual gym. It sounds
        crazy, but if you follow this plan, you will know what I am talking about.</p>

    <h3>The Second Month, Getting Explosive</h3>
    <p>This plan is just like the first month plan in the sense that you will only need a small space and no equipment
        at all. However, this plan is working to get you more explosive, improve your balance, speed, and jump height.
        This plan will test you and is a bit more challenging than month one. This plan also includes quick feet
        exercises before the workout and abs after the workout. I reccommend this program for athletes because being
        explosive is key toward improving your success on the athletic field.</p>
