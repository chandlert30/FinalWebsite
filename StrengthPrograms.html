    <h1>At Home Strength Workout Programs</h1>

    <h2>Why Workout at Home?</h2>
    <p>Working out at home is a huge time convenience and saves you a lot of money. Working out at gyms can also be a
        judgemental environment. Using our programs in the comfort of your own home allows you to workout judgement
        free.</p>

    <h3>The First Month, Building Muscle</h3>
    <img src="chandler jumping high (2).png" id=image10>
    <p>This month is all about getting building muslce using no equipment at all. All you need is a space in your house
        and that is IT. There will be many bodyweight exercises that you will be familiar with along with others that
        you may not be so familiar with. However, don't worry, our programs provide you with videos that explain to you
        how to do each exercise. There will also be ab exercises after each workout which will test you mentally, but
        getting through it will get you those 6-pack abs that you have been craving. If you stick with this plan, you
        will not only get stronger, but you may even be stronger than your friends who go to a actual gym. It sounds
        crazy, but if you follow this plan, you will know what I am talking about.</p>
    <br />

    <h3>The Second Month, Getting Explosive</h3>
    
    <p>This plan is just like the first month plan in the sense that you will only need a small space and no equipment
        at all. However, this plan is working to get you more explosive, improve your balance, speed, and jump height.
        This plan will test you and is a bit more challenging than month one. This plan also includes quick feet
        exercises before the workout and abs after the workout. I reccommend this program for athletes because being
        explosive is key toward improving your success on the athletic field.</p>


    <h3>You will need to know these 5 things before getting started.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> You will need a space in your house, room, garage, or any type of space that is comfortable for you to
            workout in.</li>

        <li>Throughout this program you will see links at the top of each week. These links show explanation videos that
            teaches
            you how to do each exercise. You can click on these links that will have videos that will explain to you how
            to do
            each workout.</li>

        <li>STRETCH. You must always stretch before you begin your workout. This will help prevent injury and help you
            get the
            maximum output of your workout.</li>

        <li>The number of reps and sets is provided, but not set and stone. If you find the number of reps and sets is
            either
            too easy or too difficult, manage it so it can be beneficial to you. They are only provided to help give you
            an idea
            as to where to start, think of it as a recommendation.</li>

        <li>Some of these workouts may be tough, it is important to push through. However, if there are exercises that
            you
            cannot do, change them up so you can do a similar form of the exercise.</li>

    </ol>
